Borrowed a few things from (the much superior) lpc.vim by Shizhu Pan -- which fixed bug with parens among other things, quit highlighting arrays/mappings as a single giant identifier, and updated the predef function list dramatically.

It is otherwise the original syntax file written by Francesco Chemolli.
